# Latest Changes

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ✅ Working

## ✨ What's New

### 1. Expandable Game Preview Panel

You can now expand the game preview to see the full 800x600 game without scrolling!

**Features**:
- 🟪 **Purple "Expand" button** - Click to maximize preview
- ⊗ **Exit button** - Return to normal view
- 📏 **Better default size** - Increased from 256px to 320px (h-80)
- ↔️ **Smooth transitions** - Animated expand/collapse
- 📜 **Scroll support** - If game is still too big, scrollbars appear

**How to Use**:
1. Open any template (Flappy Bird works great!)
2. Click the purple **"⊕ Expand"** button in the preview controls
3. Preview expands to full screen - canvas automatically hides
4. Test your game with full visibility
5. Click **"⊗ Exit"** to return to editor view

**Files Changed**:
- `src/views/EditorView.vue` - Added expand state and toggle logic
- `src/components/GamePreview.vue` - Added expand button and props

### 2. Fixed CSS Import Order

**Problem**: CSS import warnings in console due to incorrect order.

**Solution**: Moved Vue Flow CSS imports before Tailwind directives.

**Result**: Clean console output, no warnings.

**File Changed**:
- `src/style.css` - Reordered imports

## 🚀 Running the Project

The project is now fully functional:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done already)
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Server will run on http://localhost:5173 (or next available port)
```

## 🎮 Testing the Improvements

### Test Flappy Bird with Expanded Preview

1. Visit http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port Vite chose)
2. Click **"Flappy Bird"** template
3. Wait for graph to load
4. Click purple **"⊕ Expand"** button
5. Click green **"▶ Play"** button
6. Press **SPACE** to jump
7. See the full game clearly! 🎯

### Test Platformer

1. Go back to home (click "← Back")
2. Click **"Platformer"** template
3. Click **"⊕ Expand"**
4. Click **"▶ Play"**
5. Use **LEFT/RIGHT** arrows to move
6. Press **UP** to jump
7. Full visibility of platforms and player!

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ What Works
- ✅ All 17 node types registered
- ✅ Node editor (drag, drop, connect)
- ✅ Properties panel
- ✅ Game preview with Play/Stop/Reset
- ✅ **NEW**: Expandable preview
- ✅ Template loading (Flappy Bird, Platformer)
- ✅ Real-time graph execution in Phaser

### ⚠️ What Needs Work (see TODO.md)
- ⚠️ Collision detection (nodes exist, need logic)
- ⚠️ Physics configuration (need isStatic/dynamic)
- ⚠️ Save/Load UI (need auth modal)
- ⚠️ Asset upload (need UI component)

### 🚧 Planned Features
- 🚧 Audio nodes (easy to add)
- 🚧 More templates
- 🚧 Visual debugging
- 🚧 Export to HTML

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed in This Update
- ✅ CSS import warnings eliminated
- ✅ Preview panel too small (now 320px, expandable to full screen)
- ✅ Game visibility issues resolved

### Known Issues Remaining
- ⚠️ Platforms fall through each other (need physics config)
- ⚠️ OnCollide doesn't trigger (need collision setup)
- ⚠️ Save button doesn't work (need auth UI)

See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step fixes.

## 💡 Quick Tips

### For Best Experience
1. **Use expanded preview** when testing games
2. **Test incrementally** - add one node, test, repeat
3. **Check console** for Phaser errors (F12 in browser)
4. **Read templates** to understand node patterns

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Future)
Currently none implemented, but these would be useful:
- Space: Play/Stop
- F: Toggle fullscreen preview
- R: Reset game
- Ctrl+S: Save project
