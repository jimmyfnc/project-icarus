# Improvements & Fixes

Recent improvements made to the project.

## UI/UX Improvements

### 1. Expandable Game Preview (2025-10-01)

**Problem**: The game preview panel was only 256px (h-64) high, but the game canvas is 800x600. Users couldn't see the full game without scrolling.

**Solution**: Added an expandable/fullscreen preview mode.

#### Changes Made:

**src/views/EditorView.vue**:
- Added `previewExpanded` state to toggle between normal and fullscreen
- Preview panel now uses `h-80` (320px) normally, or `flex-1` (full height) when expanded
- Canvas automatically hides when preview is expanded
- Added smooth transition animation

**src/components/GamePreview.vue**:
- Added "Expand/Exit" button with purple styling
- Added `isExpanded` prop to track state
- Added `toggleFullscreen` emit event
- Game container now has `overflow-auto` for scrolling if needed
- Improved button styling with `font-medium`

#### How to Use:
1. Load any template (Flappy Bird, Platformer)
2. Click the purple **"⊕ Expand"** button
3. Preview expands to full screen
4. Click **"⊗ Exit"** to return to normal view

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Full 800x600 game visible
- ✅ Better testing experience
- ✅ Can still access node editor when needed
- ✅ Smooth animations
