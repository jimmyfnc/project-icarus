# Bug Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Game Not Loading - "No graph loaded" Error (2025-10-01)

**Symptom**:
- Templates load in editor but clicking "Play" shows only blue background
- Console shows "No graph loaded" warning
- No sprites visible

**Root Cause**:
The graph was being set on the GameScene, but when `reset()` was called (which triggers `scene.restart()`), Phaser creates a new scene instance. The new instance didn't have the graph, so `create()` exited early with "No graph loaded".

**Fix**:
1. Store the current graph in `PhaserGame` class (not just in the scene)
2. After calling `scene.reset()`, immediately reload the graph to the new scene instance
3. Added better error handling in `GamePreview.play()` to detect empty graphs
4. Added debug logging to track graph loading

**Files Modified**:
- `src/runtime/PhaserGame.ts` - Added `currentGraph` property and reload logic
- `src/components/GamePreview.vue` - Added validation and error messages

**How to Verify Fix**:
1. Load Flappy Bird template
2. Click "Play"
3. Should see: bird (yellow circle), ground (brown rectangle)
4. Press SPACE to make bird jump

### 2. CSS Import Order Warnings (2025-10-01)

**Symptom**:
Console shows warnings: "@import must precede all other statements"

**Root Cause**:
Vue Flow CSS `@import` statements were placed after `@tailwind` directives in style.css. CSS spec requires all `@import` to come before other rules.

**Fix**:
Moved all Vue Flow `@import` statements to the top of `src/style.css`, before Tailwind directives.

**File Modified**:
- `src/style.css`

### 3. Preview Panel Too Small (2025-10-01)

**Symptom**:
Game canvas is 800x600 but preview panel was only 256px high, requiring scrolling to see the full game.

**Root Cause**:
Hardcoded `h-64` (256px) height class on preview panel.

**Fix**:
- Increased default height to `h-80` (320px)
- Added expandable fullscreen mode with toggle button
- Game container now has `overflow-auto` for scrolling when needed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/views/EditorView.vue` - Added expand state
- `src/components/GamePreview.vue` - Added expand button and scrollable container

## Debugging Tips

### If Game Still Doesn't Load

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```
   "Playing game with graph:" - Should show object with nodes/edges
   "Node count:" - Should be > 0
   "PhaserGame.loadGraph called with X nodes" - Confirms graph loaded
   ```

2. **Verify Template Loaded**:
   - Look at the node canvas - should see nodes
   - Check that nodes are connected with edges
   - Click on a node - properties panel should show details

3. **Check Phaser Console**:
   - Should see "Phaser v3.90.0" message
   - No red error messages
   - "GameScene.setGraph called with:" should show node/edge count

4. **Common Issues**:
   - Empty graph: Alert will show "No game loaded!"
   - Graph not loading: Check browser network tab for JSON load errors
   - Sprites not appearing: Check that node types are registered (import in main.ts)

### Debug Commands

Add to browser console:

```javascript
// Check if store has graph
$vm0.$store.editorStore.graph

// Check node count
$vm0.$store.editorStore.nodes.length

// Check if Phaser game exists
window.game
```

## Known Remaining Issues

### High Priority
- [ ] **Collision detection doesn't work** - Bird/player fall through platforms
  - **Fix**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) Section 1
  - **Time**: 2-3 hours

- [ ] **Physics bodies not configured** - All objects fall through each other
  - **Fix**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) Section 2
  - **Time**: 1-2 hours

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Save button doesn't work** - No auth UI
  - **Fix**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) Section 3
  - **Time**: 3-4 hours

### Low Priority
- [ ] Pipes in Flappy Bird don't spawn every 2 seconds
- [ ] Camera follow doesn't work properly
- [ ] No visual feedback when nodes execute

---

## Performance Notes

### Current Performance
- Graph execution: ~60 FPS
- Node updates: Real-time
- Memory usage: Normal
- Load time: < 1 second

### Potential Optimizations
- Cache node lookups in GraphExecutor
- Use object pooling for spawned entities
- Debounce graph updates in editor
- Lazy load template JSON files
