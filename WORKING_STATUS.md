# ‚úÖ Working Status

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: üéâ **CORE SYSTEM WORKING!**

## üéÆ What Actually Works Now

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working
- ‚úÖ **Sprites appear!** - Bird, ground, player, platforms all visible
- ‚úÖ **Graph execution** - Nodes execute in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Event nodes** - OnStart, OnKey work
- ‚úÖ **Spawn nodes** - Entities spawn at correct positions
- ‚úÖ **Movement nodes** - Move, Impulse apply velocities
- ‚úÖ **Gravity nodes** - ApplyGravity makes things fall
- ‚úÖ **Templates load** - Flappy Bird and Platformer graphs load
- ‚úÖ **Node editor** - Drag, drop, connect nodes
- ‚úÖ **Properties panel** - Edit node properties
- ‚úÖ **Preview panel** - Expandable fullscreen view
- ‚úÖ **Play/Stop/Reset** - All control buttons work

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Expected)

These don't work yet but that's NORMAL - they need the fixes in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md:

- ‚ùå **Collisions** - Everything falls through everything
  - Bird falls through ground
  - Player falls through platforms
  - **Why**: No Phaser colliders set up yet
  - **Fix**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) Section 1 (2-3 hours)

- ‚ùå **Physics bodies** - Objects aren't solid
  - Platforms fall instead of staying still
  - **Why**: No `setImmovable()` on static objects
  - **Fix**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) Section 2 (1-2 hours)

- ‚ùå **OnCollide nodes** - Don't trigger
  - **Why**: Needs collision setup from fix #1
  - **Fix**: Part of collision detection implementation

- ‚ùå **Every/Timer nodes** - Not fully tested
  - Pipes might not spawn every 2 seconds
  - **Why**: Needs testing and possibly tweaking
  - **Fix**: Test and adjust interval logic

- ‚ùå **Camera follow** - Might not work smoothly
  - **Why**: Needs testing
  - **Fix**: Quick test and adjustment

- ‚ùå **Save/Load** - Buttons exist but don't work
  - **Why**: No auth UI implemented
  - **Fix**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) Section 3 (3-4 hours)

5. Blue square should move horizontally

### Create Your Own Game
1. Click "New Project"
2. From left sidebar, drag nodes to canvas:
   - OnStart ‚Üí Spawn (set sprite, position, entityId)
   - OnKey (key: RIGHT) ‚Üí Move (entity, dx: 200, dy: 0)
3. Connect the nodes (drag from right circle to left circle)
4. Set properties in right sidebar
5. Click "‚ñ∂ Play"
6. Test your creation!

## üêõ Bug Fixes That Made It Work

### The Journey (For posterity)

**Problem**: Graph wasn't loading, sprites not appearing

**Root Causes Found**:
1. Scene's `create()` lifecycle ran BEFORE `setGraph()` was called
2. When `reset()` called `scene.restart()`, it lost the graph reference
3. Timing issue with Phaser initialization vs graph loading

**Solutions Applied**:
1. Changed `reset()` to NOT restart scene, just clear entities
2. Made `setGraph()` always initialize context (handles late loading)
3. Used setTimeout to get scene reference after Phaser init
4. Added proper error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/runtime/PhaserGame.ts` - Scene acquisition timing
- `src/runtime/GameScene.ts` - Context initialization
- `src/components/GamePreview.vue` - Graph validation

**Result**: ‚úÖ WORKS!

## üìä System Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Complete & Working
- **Node Registry System** - 17 node types registered
- **Graph Executor** - Traverses and executes graphs
- **Phaser Integration** - Game engine runs graphs
- **Vue Flow Canvas** - Node editor functional
- **Pinia State** - Editor state management
- **Router** - All 3 routes work
- **Templates** - JSON templates load correctly
- **Type System** - Full TypeScript coverage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Implemented but Needs Configuration
- **Collision System** - Code exists, needs Phaser setup
- **Physics System** - Code exists, needs body config
- **Appwrite Services** - Code exists, needs auth UI

### üöß Not Yet Implemented
- **Asset Upload UI** - Service ready, no UI
- **Audio Nodes** - Easy to add (30 min)
- **Visual Debugging** - Would be helpful
- **Export to HTML** - Nice feature

## üéì What We Learned

### Key Insights
1. **Phaser lifecycle is async** - Can't assume scene is ready immediately
2. **Scene restart loses state** - Better to manually reset than restart
3. **Browser caching is aggressive** - Hard refresh often needed
4. **Timing matters** - Graph must be set after scene creation

### Best Practices Established
1. Always initialize context when graph is set
2. Don't restart scene, just clear entities
3. Add debug logging for lifecycle events
4. Validate graph before executing

## üìà Completion Status

### Overall Progress
- **MVP Scaffold**: 100% ‚úÖ

## üìù Quick Reference

### How to Test
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Click template ‚Üí Expand ‚Üí Play
```

### Console Logs You Should See
```
Phaser v3.90.0
GameScene.create called, graph exists: false
PhaserGame constructed
PhaserGame.loadGraph called with 10 nodes
PhaserGame: Scene acquired and ready
Applying queued graph with 10 nodes
GameScene.setGraph called, graph has 10 nodes
Initializing runtime context
Playing game with graph: ...
```

### If Sprites Don't Appear
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito window
4. Check console for errors
5. Verify graph has nodes (should show "10 nodes")
